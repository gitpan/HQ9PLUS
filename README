NAME
    hq9p - An HQ9+ Interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     hq9p program_file

ABSTRACT
    The HQ9+ programming language has a simple syntax, and solves several
    very common problems that plague programmers.

DESCRIPTION
    There are four commands. While this is a very simple language, it allows
    you to easily do some things that would be very difficult in other
    programming languages.

    All commands may appear more than once in your program, but it could
    produce some nasty output. All commands are case-insensitive.

  Commands

   h

    Prints "Hello, world!" to the screen, sans the quotes. It will be
    trailed by a new-line character.

   q

    This makes your program a quine. It will print copies of itself.

   9

    Prints out the entire lyrics of the "99 bottles of beer on the wall"
    song.

   +

    Increments the accumulator.

EXAMPLES
    Print "Hello, world!".

     h

    Print a quine.

     q

    Print four copies of your program.

     qqqq

    Increment the accumulator.

     +

    Do it a lot.

DIAGNOSTICS
  Unknown command: %s

    All unknown commands will produce this warning. It's not wholy useful to
    quit execution, so a warning to STDERR will suffice. Unknown commands
    are any characters not included in the set case-insensitive set: 'h',
    'q', '9', '+', and white-space characters.

  Can't open %s: %s

    The program will stop execution in the case of being unable to open a
    file. This may happen for the program file when passed to the
    interpreter, or when the command 'q' executes.

  Can't close %s: %s

    The program will stop execution in the rare case of being unable to
    close a file. This may happen for the program file when passed to the
    interpreter, or when the command 'q' executes.
